## Elastic SIEM Lab Project

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a home lab for Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using Elastic's web portal and a Parrot OS virtual machine (VM). Follow this guide to learn how to generate security events, configure an agent to forward data, and query and analyze logs within Elastic SIEM.

---

### Prerequisites

- **VirtualBox** or **VMware**
  - Download VirtualBox: [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Basic knowledge of Linux and virtualization software

---

### Steps

#### 1. Set Up an Elastic Account

1. **Sign Up**: Create a free Elastic Cloud account.
2. **Log In**: Access the Elastic Cloud console.
3. **Start Trial**: Click "Start your free trial" (14 days free).
4. **Create Deployment**: Choose "Elasticsearch" as the deployment type.
5. **Configuration**: Select region and deployment size, then click "Create Deployment."
6. **Finish Setup**: Wait for deployment configuration.

#### 2. Setting Up the Parrot OS VM

1. **Download Parrot OS**: Get the Parrot Security Edition from [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/).
2. **Create VM**:
   - In VirtualBox or VMware, create a new VM using the downloaded ISO.
   - Follow on-screen prompts to install Parrot OS.
   - Log in with your chosen credentials.

#### 3. Setting Up the Elastic Agent

1. **Navigate to Integrations**:
   - Log in to Elastic SIEM, go to Kibana menu, and select "Add Integrations."
2. **Search for Elastic Defend**:
   - Find and click "Elastic Defend."
3. **Install Agent**:
   - Follow instructions to install the agent on Parrot OS VM.
   - Run the provided command in Parrot OS terminal.
4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check agent status: `sudo systemctl status elastic-agent.service`

#### 4. Generating Security Events

1. **Install Nmap**:
   - Run `sudo apt-get install nmap`
2. **Run Nmap Scans**:
   - Execute commands like `sudo nmap <vm-ip>`, `nmap -sS <ip>`, `nmap -p- <ip>`

#### 5. Querying Security Events

1. **Access Logs**:
   - Go to “Logs” tab under “Observability” in Elastic SIEM.
2. **Search Logs**:
   - Use filters like `event.action: "nmap_scan"` or `process.args: "sudo"`.
3. **View Results**:
   - Click “Search” to review logs.

#### 6. Create a Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Dashboards**:
   - Go to “Dashboards” under “Analytics” in the Elastic web portal.
2. **Create New Dashboard**:
   - Click “Create dashboard” and “Create Visualization.”
   - Choose “Area” or “Line” chart.
3. **Configure Metrics**:
   - Set “Count” as vertical field and “Timestamp” as horizontal field.
   - Save the visualization.

#### 7. Create an Alert

1. **Go to Alerts**:
   - Click “Alerts” under “Security” in Elastic SIEM.
2. **Create New Rule**:
   - Click “Manage rules” and “Create new rule.”
   - Choose “Custom query” and set conditions like `event.action: "nmap_scan"`.
3. **Configure Alert**:
   - Name the rule, set severity, and define actions (e.g., email notification).
   - Click “Create and enable rule.”
